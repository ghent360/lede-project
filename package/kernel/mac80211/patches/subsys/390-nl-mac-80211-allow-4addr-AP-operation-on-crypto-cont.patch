Subject: [PATCH] {nl,mac}80211: allow 4addr AP operation on crypto controlled
 devices

As per the current design, in the case of sw crypto controlled devices,
it is the device which advertises the support for AP/VLAN iftype based
on it's ability to tranmsit packets encrypted in software
(In VLAN functionality, group traffic generated for a specific
VLAN group is always encrypted in software). Commit db3bdcb9c3ff
("mac80211: allow AP_VLAN operation on crypto controlled devices")
has introduced this change.

Since 4addr AP operation also uses AP/VLAN iftype, this conditional
way of advertising AP/VLAN support has broken 4addr AP mode operation on
crypto controlled devices which do not support VLAN functionality.

In the case of ath10k driver, not all firmwares have support for VLAN
functionality but all can support 4addr AP operation. Because AP/VLAN
support is not advertised for these devices, 4addr AP operations are
also blocked.

Fix this by allowing 4addr operation on devices which do not support
AP/VLAN iftype but can support 4addr AP operation (decision is based on
the wiphy flag WIPHY_FLAG_4ADDR_AP).
