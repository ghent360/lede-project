Subject: [PATCH FIX] spi: bcm-qspi: switch back to reading flash using smaller
 chunks
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fixing/optimizing bcm_qspi_bspi_read() performance introduced two
changes:
1) It added a loop to read all requested data using multiple BSPI ops.
2) It bumped max size of a single BSPI block request from 256 to 512 B.

The later change resulted in occasional BSPI timeouts causing a
regression.

For some unknown reason hardware doesn't always handle reads as expected
when using 512 B chunks. In such cases it may happen that BSPI returns
amount of requested bytes without the last 1-3 ones. It provides the
remaining bytes later but doesn't raise an interrupt until another LR
start.

Switching back to 256 B reads fixes that problem and regression.
